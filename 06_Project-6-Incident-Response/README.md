### **Project Title: Incident Response Playbook for a Phishing Attack**

-----

**1. Project Overview**

  * **Goal:** To create a detailed, step-by-step playbook for responding to a security incident, demonstrating a structured and methodical approach to managing a crisis.
  * **Scenario:** This project simulates a critical security event: a targeted phishing attack that has compromised a user account, potentially leading to a larger data breach. My objective was to act as the lead incident responder and create a comprehensive playbook to guide a team through the entire incident response lifecycle, from initial detection to final recovery.
  * **Key Deliverables:**
      * A professional **Incident Response Playbook** document outlining the 6 phases of the incident response lifecycle.
      * A detailed narrative in this `README.md` file of a simulated incident, documenting the steps taken at each phase.

**4. The Process: My Methodical Approach**

This project applies the foundational principles of incident response from **Course 6** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I've broken down the response into the six phases of the incident response lifecycle to ensure all actions are deliberate and well-documented.

#### **Phase 1: Preparation**

  * **Action:** Prior to the incident, the focus is on readiness. I would ensure that a full team of responders (IT, Legal, Communications) is identified, roles are assigned, and contact information is readily available. This phase also includes verifying that a clean, tested backup of critical data exists and is stored offline.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This is the crucial first step taught in **Course 6**, highlighting the importance of proactive planning and establishing a clear chain of command before an incident occurs.

#### **Phase 2: Detection and Analysis**

  * **Action:** The incident is detected when a user reports a suspicious email and a subsequent SIEM alert flags a login from an unusual geographic location. My immediate action would be to analyze the email headers to identify the malicious source and investigate the log to determine the scope of the compromise.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This phase directly applies the detection skills learned in the course, demonstrating an understanding of how to interpret security alerts and begin an investigation.

#### **Phase 3: Containment**

  * **Action:** The primary goal here is to stop the spread of the attack. My containment actions would include isolating the infected host from the network, disabling the compromised user account, and blocking the malicious domain at the firewall.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This is a key step in the incident response lifecycle. It shows a practical application of the containment strategies discussed in the curriculum to minimize damage and prevent further unauthorized access.

#### **Phase 4: Eradication**

  * **Action:** Once contained, the threat must be removed. This involves a full-system scan on the infected host to ensure no remnants of the malicious software remain. A digital forensics review would be conducted to understand how the attacker gained entry. I would then reset the user's password and enforce multi-factor authentication.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This demonstrates an understanding of the eradication process, which is about systematically removing the threat from the environment.

#### **Phase 5: Recovery**

  * **Action:** With the threat eradicated, the focus shifts to restoring operations. The user's account and device would be scanned and deemed clean before being reconnected to the network. An organization-wide email would be sent to all employees to alert them of the phishing campaign and provide security reminders.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This showcases proficiency in the recovery phase, emphasizing the importance of validated backups and a systematic approach to restoring normal operations.

#### **Phase 6: Post-Incident Activity**

  * **Action:** Following the incident, I would conduct a post-mortem analysis. This involves creating a comprehensive report detailing what happened, how we responded, and what we learned. I would also propose new security controls, such as enhanced endpoint protection and mandatory security awareness training, to prevent a similar attack from occurring in the future.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This final phase demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement, a hallmark of a mature security program, and aligns with the post-incident analysis concepts taught in the course.

**5. Results and Key Takeaways**

This project demonstrates my ability to think critically under pressure and to apply a structured, methodical approach to a complex and high-stakes security incident. By creating this playbook, I solidified my understanding of the entire incident response lifecycle and the critical importance of preparedness. This project proves that I can not only detect threats but also plan and execute a successful response, a crucial skill for any cybersecurity professional.
