### **Project Title: Incident Response Playbook for a Ransomware Attack**

-----

**1. Project Overview**

  * **Goal:** To create a detailed, step-by-step playbook for responding to a security incident, demonstrating a structured and methodical approach to managing a crisis.
  * **Scenario:** This project simulates a critical security event: a ransomware attack that has encrypted a company's financial and HR data. My objective was to act as the lead incident responder and create a comprehensive playbook to guide a team through the entire incident response lifecycle, from initial detection to final recovery.
  * **Key Deliverables:**
      * A professional **Incident Response Playbook** document outlining the 6 phases of the incident response lifecycle.
      * A detailed narrative in this `README.md` file of a simulated incident, documenting the steps taken at each phase.

**4. The Process: My Methodical Approach**

This project applies the foundational principles of incident response from **Course 6** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I've broken down the response into the six phases of the incident response lifecycle to ensure all actions are deliberate and well-documented.

#### **Phase 1: Preparation**

  * **Action:** Prior to the incident, the focus is on readiness. I would ensure that a full team of responders (IT, Legal, Communications) is identified, roles are assigned, and contact information is readily available. This phase also includes verifying that a clean, tested backup of critical data exists and is stored offline.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This is the crucial first step taught in **Course 6**, highlighting the importance of proactive planning and establishing a clear chain of command before an incident occurs.

#### **Phase 2: Detection and Analysis**

  * **Action:** The incident is detected via a SIEM alert indicating unusual file encryption activity. My immediate action would be to analyze the alert to determine the scope of the compromise. This involves reviewing logs to identify the initial point of entry, the user account involved, and the speed of the data encryption.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This phase directly applies the detection skills learned in the course, demonstrating an understanding of how to interpret security alerts and begin an investigation.

#### **Phase 3: Containment**

  * **Action:** The primary goal here is to stop the ransomware from spreading. My containment actions would include isolating the infected host from the network, disabling the compromised user account, and blocking the malicious IP address at the firewall.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This is a key step in the incident response lifecycle. It shows a practical application of the containment strategies discussed in the curriculum to minimize damage and prevent further unauthorized access.

#### **Phase 4: Eradication**

  * **Action:** Once contained, the malware must be removed. This involves a full-system scan on the infected host to ensure no remnants of the ransomware or other malicious software remain. A digital forensics review would be conducted to understand how the attacker gained entry.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This demonstrates an understanding of the eradication process, which is about systematically removing the threat from the environment.

#### **Phase 5: Recovery**

  * **Action:** With the threat eradicated, the focus shifts to restoring operations. I would restore the critical data from the clean, offline backup. The restored system would be thoroughly tested to ensure full functionality and verify that no malicious code remains before bringing it back online.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This showcases proficiency in the recovery phase, emphasizing the importance of validated backups and a systematic approach to restoring normal operations.

#### **Phase 6: Post-Incident Activity**

  * **Action:** Following the incident, I would conduct a post-mortem analysis. This involves creating a comprehensive report detailing what happened, how we responded, and what we learned. I would also propose new security controls, such as enhanced endpoint protection and mandatory security awareness training, to prevent a similar attack from occurring in the future.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This final phase demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement, a hallmark of a mature security program, and aligns with the post-incident analysis concepts taught in the course.

**5. Results and Key Takeaways**

This project demonstrates my ability to think critically under pressure and to apply a structured, methodical approach to a complex and high-stakes security incident. By creating this playbook, I solidified my understanding of the entire incident response lifecycle and the critical importance of preparedness. This project proves that I can not only detect threats but also plan and execute a successful response, a crucial skill for any cybersecurity professional.
