### **Project Title: Vulnerability Management & Remediation Plan**

-----

**1. Project Overview**

  * **Goal:** To perform a simulated vulnerability assessment and create a prioritized remediation plan, demonstrating a methodical approach to identifying and mitigating security weaknesses.
  * **Scenario:** This project simulates the role of a security analyst performing an internal audit for a company. The objective is to identify a range of vulnerabilities, from misconfigured services to outdated software, and develop a clear, actionable plan to address them based on their severity.
  * **Key Deliverables:**
      * A **Vulnerability Scan Summary Report** documenting the findings of a simulated scan.
      * A **Prioritized Remediation Plan** outlining specific steps to fix each vulnerability.
      * A write-up explaining how industry frameworks, like the MITRE ATT\&CK, can be used to understand the potential impact of these vulnerabilities.

**4. The Process: My Methodical Approach**

This project demonstrates a real-world application of vulnerability management, a core competency taught in **Course 5** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. My process was divided into three key phases, from initial discovery to final remediation planning.

#### **Phase 1: Simulated Vulnerability Scanning**

  * **Action:** I initiated a simulated vulnerability scan of a target system to discover open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities. The output from a tool like Nmap provided a foundational report of the system's external posture.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This phase directly applies the concepts of vulnerability scanning and asset discovery covered in **Course 5**, where we learned how to identify potential weak points in a system's defenses.

#### **Phase 2: Analysis and Prioritization**

  * **Action:** Following the scan, I analyzed the findings to understand the potential risks. I prioritized each vulnerability using a severity scale, similar to the **CVSS**, to determine which issues required immediate attention versus those that could be addressed later. I also used the **MITRE ATT\&CK Framework** to understand how an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This step highlights the critical-thinking skills taught in the certificate, demonstrating my ability to move beyond a simple scan to a strategic analysis of potential attack vectors and their impact on an organization.

#### **Phase 3: Remediation Planning**

  * **Action:** For each identified vulnerability, I created a remediation plan. The plan provides specific, actionable steps to fix the issue and reduce risk. Examples include patching outdated software, closing unnecessary ports, and reconfiguring services to follow security best practices.
  * **Reference to Cert:** This final phase connects directly to the curriculum's emphasis on creating a full vulnerability management lifecycle, from identification to remediation and recovery, as discussed throughout the program.

**5. Results and Key Takeaways**

This project demonstrates my ability to proactively identify and manage security vulnerabilities, a crucial skill for any cybersecurity role. The most valuable takeaway was learning to think like an attacker and use frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK to understand the "why" behind an attack. This project showcases my proficiency in taking raw scan data, turning it into actionable intelligence, and creating a clear remediation plan to improve an organization's security posture.
