# My Professional statement

I am an analytical, solution orientated thinker with a fascination for understanding how things work. I have a high value for ethics and respect as well as the ability to constantly learn. What draws me to Cybersecurity is both the ‘Sword & Shield’ aspects respectfully. From the Sword aspect of it I get to ethically test my skills & knowledge with the aim of retrieving company information from a locked company device for example, while on the other hand I also get to be apparat of the Shield aspect of it where I could be protecting the company from all threats both internal & external.

My name is Zipho, I and aspiring Cybersecurity’s Specialist (Security Analyst). I am passionate about technology, code and pushing myself to levels I haven’t achieved before even if it may be difficult at times.
