# Zipho Mashaba | Google Certified Cybersecurity Professional

### **Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst (Security Analyst), passionate about defending digital assets and building resilient systems. I am passionate about technology, code and pushing myself to levels I haven’t achieved before, even if it may be difficult at times.**



**About Me**

I am an analytical, solution orientated thinker (that deals in solutions, not probleams) with a fascination for understanding how things work. I have a high value for ethics as well as the ability to constantly learn & excersise that knowledge. What draws me to Cybersecurity is both the ‘Sword & Shield’ aspects respectfully. From the Sword aspect of it I get to ethically test my skills & knowledge through retriving sensitive information to asssit the company in it's endeavours, while on the other hand I also get to be apart of the Shield aspect of it where I would be protecting the company from all threats both internal & external.
