### **Project Title: Botium Toys Security Audit & Risk Assessment**

---

**1. Project Overview**

* **Goal:** To perform a comprehensive security assessment and create a mitigation plan for a fictional company, effectively identifying and addressing potential security risks.

* **Scenario:** This project simulates a real-world engagement where I was tasked with conducting a security audit and risk assessment for 'Botium Toys,' a hypothetical toy manufacturer. The company's digital assets include customer PII, intellectual property (toy designs), and internal business operations, making security a top priority.

* **Key Deliverables:**
    * A **Risk Register** spreadsheet documenting assets, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact, and a final risk score.
    * A detailed **Mitigation Plan** document outlining recommended security controls and actions to reduce identified risks.
    * A write-up that explains the process, referencing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the CIA Triad.

**2. Skills Demonstrated**

* **Risk Management**
* **Threat Identification**s
* **Vulnerability Analysis**
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
* **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
* **Technical Writing**
* **Compliance Auditing**

**3. Tools & Technologies**

* **Frameworks:**
    * NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
    * CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

* **Software:**
    * Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel (for the Risk Register)
    * Google Docs

* **Concepts:**
    * Threat Modeling
    * Risk Prioritization

**4. The Process: My Methodical Approach**

This project was executed following a structured, methodical approach that aligns with the principles learned throughout the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

* **Phase 1: Information Gathering**
    * **Action:** I began by understanding the business's critical assets, including customer data, intellectual property (toy designs), and supply chain operations. I also identified key stakeholders and business goals to ensure my security recommendations would align with the company's mission.
    * **Reference to Cert:** This foundational step aligns directly with **Course 2**, where we learned about identifying, prioritizing, and valuing assets to determine their importance to the organization.

* **Phase 2: Risk and Vulnerability Identification**
    * **Action:** I performed a threat modeling exercise to identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities. This included analyzing common threats to manufacturing and e-commerce, such as phishing campaigns targeting employees or ransomware attacks on manufacturing systems, and mapping them to assets using the CIA Triad.
    * **Reference to Cert:** This demonstrates the concepts from **Course 5**, "Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities," and the practical application of the CIA Triad to define and categorize potential risks.

* **Phase 3: Assessment and Analysis**
    * **Action:** Using the NIST CSF as a guide, I assessed the existing controls and documented vulnerabilities. I then created a comprehensive risk register, prioritizing each risk based on its potential likelihood and impact. This process allowed me to focus on the most critical risks that posed the greatest threat to the business.
    
* **Phase 4: Mitigation and Recommendation**
    * **Action:** For each high-priority risk, I proposed specific, actionable security controls and mitigation strategies. For example, to mitigate the risk of a ransomware attack, I recommended implementing a regular backup policy and conducting employee security awareness training.
    * **Reference to Cert:** This final phase draws directly from the incident response and mitigation strategies discussed throughout the certificate, especially in **Course 6**, where we learned how to plan for and respond to security incidents.
	
**5. Results and Key Takeaways**

This project solidified my understanding of the risk management lifecycle from start to finish. The most valuable lesson was learning how to take abstract security concepts and translate them into a tangible, prioritized plan that is easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand. I demonstrated my ability to apply the NIST CSF to a real-world scenario and communicate the financial and reputational impact of security vulnerabilities. This project proves my foundational competence in preparing a business to withstand and recover from cyber threats.
